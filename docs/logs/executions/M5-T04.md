**Task:** M5-T04
**Status:** Cancelled / Skipped
**Date:** 2026-01-02

**Reason:**
- Decision made to keep Documentation Templates (`docs/*.md`) and Agent System Prompts in English universally.
- This ensures better reasoning performance by LLMs.
- Localization is handled strictly via the "Output Language Rule" injected by `transformers.js` (M5-T03) and the CLI UI (M5-T02).

**Changes:**
- None. `templates/` folder structure remains flat.

**Self-Check:**
- [x] No regression
