**Task:** M5-T02
**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2026-01-02

**Changes:**
- **Updated `src/index.js`:**
    - Imported `setLocale`, `t`, `getLocale` from `src/lib/i18n.js`.
    - Added Language Selection prompt as the first step of the wizard.
    - Replaced all usages of `MESSAGES.*` with `t('*')`.
    - Passed `locale` to `processAgentsInstallation` to enable future injection logic.
    - Updated cancel handling to use localized messages.

**Self-Check:**
- [x] Linter Passed (Syntax checked)
- [x] Flow Logic Verified (Language selection -> Set Locale -> Use Locale in subsequent prompts)
